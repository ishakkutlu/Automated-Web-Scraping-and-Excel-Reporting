# Automated Web Scraping, CAPTCHA Bypass, and Excel Reporting

A fully automated workflow combining Python-based web scraping with CAPTCHA/anti-bot bypass techniques and Excel VBA reporting to extract, clean, and structure legal case data from hyperlinked sources — demonstrating advanced data acquisition, resilient scraping, and structured reporting capabilities.

## What Problems It Solves:
- Manual scraping from multiple hyperlinks is time-intensive and error-prone.
- Bot protection and anti-scraping mechanisms make manual browsing inefficient.
- Data from web pages often needs cleaning, structuring, and formatting before use.

## Key Highlights:
- End-to-End Automation: Python handles web scraping, VBA automates Excel reporting — no manual intervention needed after launch.
- Anti-Scraping Measures: Integration with APIs and strategic bypassing techniques to handle bot detection and captchas.
- Structured Output: Extracted data (case details, court names, defendants) is organized into clean, user-friendly Excel sheets with hyperlinks.
- Data Cleaning and Validation: Pre-processing scripts ensure that extracted information is usable, consistent, and formatted for further analysis.
- Expandable Use Case: Easily adaptable for scraping real estate listings, product prices, financial data, or any hyperlinked web-based content.

## Solution Components:
- Web Scraper: Python-based automated navigation and extraction
- Data Structuring: Cleaning and organizing scraped results
- Excel Reporting: VBA automation for structured saving and formatting
- Anti-Scraping API Integration: Handles bot protections automatically
